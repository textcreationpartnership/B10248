            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:192154:7"/> inſtance of the worthy Author of this excellent and uſeful Diſcourſe, I was deſired to advertiſe thee, that ſome honourable Friends of his put him upon this preſent work, which in their noble concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons would be very acceptable to the Publick. By this To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pographical Diſcourſe thou art brought to more familiar acquaintance with the ſcite, ſtrength, preſent ſtate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe Belgick Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, which for this laſt Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury had ſo bravely quit them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, maugre the utmoſt Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licies and Hoſtilities of their great and formidable Enemies:
<pb facs="tcp:192154:7"/> and when you hear of this or that other Town or Caſtle of theirs either taken or beſieged, upon a ſlight peruſal of it, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all occaſions, you may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to judge of thoſe matters. The Author hereof hath ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſulted with moſt of the Grave Writers both Coſmogra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers &amp; Hiſtorians, and others of the greateſt note which have hitherto written of thoſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Provinces, from whom (beſides his own obſervations) he hath received no ſmall light &amp; aſſiſtance: &amp; having brought this Web out of the Loom, he here preſents it to the judicious Eye of the Candid Reader,
<pb facs="tcp:192154:8"/> wherein, without much trouble or coſt, he may behold the ſad face in its full dimenſion, of the late moſt High and Mighty States of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, that ſeemed ſo lately to eclipſe and ſhadow much of the Grandeur and Glory of the moſt Potent and abſolute Princes, now lamentably it ſelf eclipſed, and rent in pieces; and Peace, the faireſt flower in Paradiſe, and the pleaſanteſt Fruit upon the Tree of Life, is here in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ile: ſo that you may ſay of them, as the Poet of <hi>Rome:</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>They who the Ruines of firſt</hi> Rome <hi>behold,</hi>

                  <l>
                     <hi>May ſay,</hi> Rome <hi>is not now, but was of old.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>If in <hi>Anno 1584,</hi> the <hi>poor diſtreſſed People of the Low Countries</hi> was their Epithet in all their humble Addreſſes to the then Queen of <hi>England,</hi> what they then ſpake as Politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, poſſibly the ſame they may now ſay as Realiſts. But Pride will have its Fall ſooner or later; Perfidiouſneſs and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude will never go long unpuniſhed.</p>
            <p>And truly three of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt things in the world are,
<pb facs="tcp:192154:9"/> To Quadrate a Circle; to finde out the Philoſophers Stone; and to make the Dutch grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. The firſt Office of Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is to receive a good turn Civilly, then to retain it in Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and acknowledge it; and laſtly, to endeavour a requital. How far they are from theſe, their Inſolencies to the Engliſh Nation will eaſily tell you; they daily do heap injuries on the Engliſh whom they have ſo highly wronged, as if the latter injuries would give counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Juſtice to the former: and to ſpeak truly, if we ſhould be left to their mercies, we ſhould be ſtript as bare as <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genes</hi> did <hi>Plato</hi>'s Man.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:192154:9"/>
            <p>'Twas <hi>England</hi> that firſt raiſed them, and it was the King of Great <hi>Britain</hi> that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God would have preſerved and protected them, if they had kept their Ancient Boundaries, and not been too ignorant of their true Intereſt. At preſent they ſeem to the world a loſt People, full of intrinſick confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and upon the point of Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine; and they that have been reckoned for Great and Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Letters in the Worlds Alphabet, are now almoſt blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out.</p>
            <p>For their Country, it was in the General for its dimenſions, fuller planted with People, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="tcp:192154:10"/> Great Towns, Caſtles, For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, Bulwarks, Forts, Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, and for Military De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, then any other Countrie in Europe. Their Naval For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were prodigious, befitting Wonder rather then Words, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven a Terrour to the Great Princes of the World. For their trade, it far exceeded that of the Neighbouring Princes; and in the Oeconomy of it more prudently managed. To every town they aſſigned ſome Staple-Commodity; As to <hi>Dort</hi> the Germane Wines and Corn: To <hi>Middleburgh</hi> the French and Spaniſh Wines: To <hi>Trevere</hi> the Scotch Trade: In <hi>Leyden,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:192154:10"/> in reſpect of her long Siege, was erected an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity: to <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> Knitting and Weaving; and to <hi>Rotterdam</hi> formerly (now <hi>Dort</hi>) the Engliſh Cloth: this maketh their Towns ſo equally rich and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous.</p>
            <p>The Hollanders (the beſt Copy of Thrift in Chriſtendom) teach their little Ditches to bear Boats; not that their Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are more docible in this kinde then ours, but they are the more ingenious and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious School-Maſters of the leſſon of publique advantage, making every place in their Provinces to have acceſs to

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:192154:31"/> which made a great confuſion in the town, inſomuch as the people came in great multitudes to <hi>Peter Adrianſon</hi> the Burgermaſter, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring their miſery and want, and uſing many threatning words that he might agree with the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy: but he anſwered them, and ſaid, <hi>My beloved Fellow Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, I have made an Oath, which I mean by the grace of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to keep: If my death, ſith I must die, may any ways profit you, it's all one to me, whether you or the Enemy kill me: and therefore if this Carkaſs of mine will do you any good, in Gods Name take it, cut it in pieces, and divide it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt you, as far as it may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſtretch; for I ſhall be contented therewith.</hi>

                  <p>But certain the deliverance of this Town can be attributed to none but to God Almighty; for though the Prince did uſe all means by breaking of Ditches, drawing up of Sluces, and drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Country almoſt to the Town, yet the waters were not ſo deep as to carry Boats, until God ſent a ſtrong South-weſt-winde, which drave the Sea into the Rivers and Land, that great Boats paſs'd afloat and victuall'd the Town: and two days after it was victuall'd, came ſo ſtrong a North-weſt-winde, that beat back the Sea again from whence it came; as doth appear in the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the <hi>Netherlands.</hi>

                     <hi>Balder</hi> General for the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> when he raiſed the Siege, left in his Lodgings the Town of <hi>Leyden</hi> pictur'd with her Royal Ways, Paths, and Chanels of Water, and in ſuch manner
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:192154:32"/> as they were guarded and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with Forts: and under the Picture was written: <q>
                        <l>Vale Civitas, valete Caſtella parva, quia</l>

                  <p>They of <hi>Leyden</hi> had a perfect hatred againſt the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and therefore a <hi>Zealander</hi> being in the Town, and having ſhot a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> he rip'd him open, pluck'd his heart out of his body, as he was half dead; and when he had knawn it with his teeth, he caſt it away from him: this knawn heart was afterwards ſeen in <hi>Delph</hi> by many credible people, and the very print of his teeth in it, as it's delivered to us by good Authority.</p>
                  <p>The Fort <hi>Waddinghe,</hi> which the <hi>Spaniards</hi> had made againſt the town, did much annoy the

                  </p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Some of them wore about them in a ſilver Creſcent theſe words: <hi>Rather the</hi> Turk <hi>then a</hi> Spaniard; <hi>becauſe the</hi> Turk <hi>paying his Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute gives Liberty of Conſcience, but the</hi> Spaniard <hi>none.</hi>

                  <p>I cannot forget one memorable Paſſage at this Siege. An <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Gentleman here had in a Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley his right Arm ſhot off with a Cannon-Bullet; he took it up, and carried it along with him unto his Chyrurgeon at his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, where without being ſick or diſtempered, he held it in his left
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:192154:33"/> hand, ſaying; <hi>This is the Arm which to day at Dinner ſerv'd the whole Body.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There is a memorable Story, if true, which we have read in ſeveral eminent Authors; which is thus: <hi>Anno</hi> 1316 there hap'ning a great Famine, a poor Woman went to her own Siſter that was very rich, to borrow a Loaf of Bread to ſave her and her Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren from ſtarving: her Siſter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that ſhe had any in the houſe: ſhe inſiſted that ſhe had: whereupon her rich Siſter fell a curſing and ſwearing, <hi>praying God that if ſhe had any, it might be turn'd into a Stone:</hi> which God miraculouſly ſuffer'd to be done, as it's ſaid, to the confuſion of this pitileſs and wretched Woman. In St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Church in the ſame City, there is one of theſe Loaves ſafely kept to this day in a place iron'd about, for a perpetual re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance
